# flask-CD
This is a repo to contain my first project for course IDS-721 at Duke University in Feb 2021.

# Content
In this project I deployed a simple flask app on GCP platform with continuous delivery.
The flask app has 2 different routes:
- /html: this will display some basic html;
- /iris: this will display the famous Iris dataset, which is found on [this website on Github Gist.](https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7)
